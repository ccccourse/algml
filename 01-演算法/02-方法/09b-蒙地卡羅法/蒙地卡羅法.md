Las Vegas (LV) Algorithms - Are randomized algorithms which always give the correct answer. The running time however is not fixed (not deterministic), that is it can vary for the same input. For eg. Randomized Quick Sort always gives a correctly sorted array as its output. However it takes  O(nlogn) time on average but can be as bad as  O(n2)
in the worst case.

Monte Carlo (MC) Algorithms - Are randomized algorithms which may not always give the right answer. The running time for these algorithms is fixed however. There is also generally a probability guarantee that the answer is right. For eg. if you used a non perfect hash to assign hash values to two different strings and then try to see if the strings are the same or not by comparing the hash values, then this is like a MC algorithm. You will mostly get the right answer but sometimes two different strings can end up having the same hash value.

Most MC algorithms can be converted to LV algorithms by adding a check to see if the answer given is right and if not running the MC algorithm again till the right answer is produced. In fact this is what the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm does by actually comparing sub-strings whose hash values are the same. This algorithm now has  O(m+n) running time on average but can be  O(mn) in the worst case but always gives you the right answer like a typical LV algorithm.
