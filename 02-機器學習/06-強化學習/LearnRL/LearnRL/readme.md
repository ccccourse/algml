# Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction
This is a self-learning note for reinforcement learning. 

My reading is [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation-ebook/dp/B008H5Q8VA) which is written by Richard S.Sutton and Andrew G.Barto.

There are chinese notes on [my hackmd](https://hackmd.io/s/Sy6-512wQ), and only script on my GitHub.

I will move note to GitHubPage when someday I have time.
