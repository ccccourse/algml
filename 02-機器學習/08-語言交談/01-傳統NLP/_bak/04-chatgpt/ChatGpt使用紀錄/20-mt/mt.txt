Russia has fired a barrage of missiles at targets across Ukraine for the eighth time in eight weeks.

Significant disruption to the power grid was reported, mainly in the east. In the south, Odesa was without power. Ukraine says four people were killed.

But the strikes, which came nearly two weeks after the last, may have done less damage than on previous occasions.

Ukraine says it shot down 60 of the 70 missiles fired by Russia. Moscow says it hit all 17 of its targets.

In his video address late on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the strikes had also hit electricity supplies in neighbouring Moldova.

"This once again proves that Russia's ability to carry out such massive terrorist attacks is a threat not only to Ukraine, but also to our entire region."

Previous Russian attacks have hit Ukraine's energy grid, leaving millions without electricity and heat as winter arrives.

Warnings that Russia was planning a fresh wave of attacks have been circulating for several days. They eventually arrived just hours after a series of explosions at two airbases deep inside Russia, which Moscow blamed on Ukrainian drones intercepted by Russian air-defences.

Three servicemen were killed and two aircraft were lightly damaged in the explosions, Russia's defence ministry said. Ukraine has yet to comment.

Russia blames Ukraine for attacks on two airfields
For Ukraine's hard-pressed electrical engineers, Monday's missile strikes are likely to mean another round of emergency repairs, often to facilities hit repeatedly in recent weeks.

Before today's strikes, officials in Kyiv were talking about moving from highly disruptive emergency blackouts, which often last for many hours, to more manageable scheduled power cuts which offer civilians some badly needed predictability.

Those plans may now be on hold, but it seems Monday's damage could be less extensive than in previous attacks.

Another striking feature of the latest Russian strikes is the apparent absence of Iranian-made "kamikaze" drones.

Ukrainian officials recently said Russia had used up its supply of the unmanned vehicles. Another Ukrainian military official said cold weather had prevented Russia from deploying them.

Either way, they do not appear to have been used since mid-November.

根據這篇文章，俄羅斯已經第八週連續第八次向烏克蘭發射飛彈。報告顯示，烏克蘭東部的電網受到了顯著破壞，南部的敖德薩市沒有電。烏克蘭稱有四人死亡。但是，這次空襲比以往的次數要少。烏克蘭稱他們擊落了俄羅斯發射的70枚飛彈中的60枚。莫斯科方面稱他們擊中了所有17個目標。烏克蘭總統梅倫斯基在周一晚間的視頻講話中表示，空襲也擊中了鄰國摩爾多瓦的電力供應。這再次證明俄羅斯能夠進行如此大規模的恐怖襲擊不僅威脅到烏克蘭，也威脅到我們整個地區。之前的俄羅斯襲擊擊中了烏克蘭的能源網絡，使數百萬人失去了電力和暖氣。有關俄羅斯計劃再次進行襲擊的警告已經流傳了幾天。他們最終在俄羅斯內部兩個空軍基地發生一系列爆炸數小時後到達。俄羅斯軍方稱，三名軍人死亡，兩架飛機輕微損壞。烏克蘭尚未發表評論。俄羅斯指責

繼續

根據文章，俄羅斯指責烏克蘭為俄羅斯兩個空軍基地的襲擊負責。俄羅斯對烏克蘭進行的持續襲擊對烏克蘭電力工程師來說可能意味著另一輪緊急修復，這些工程師通常需要修復近幾周反复受到攻擊的設施。在今天的襲擊之前，基輔的官員正在討論如何從經常持續數小時的高度破壞性的緊急停電轉向更易管理的定時停電，以為平民提供急需的可預測性。這些計劃可能現在會暫停，但似乎周一的損害可能比以前的襲擊要少。俄羅斯最新襲擊的另一個明顯特點是似乎沒有伊朗製造的“神風”無人機。烏克蘭官員最近表示，俄羅斯已經使用完了無人機的供應。另一名烏克蘭軍事官員表示，寒冷的天氣阻止了俄羅斯部署無人機。不管怎麼樣，它們似乎自11月中旬以來就沒有被使用過。

（中央社香港5日綜合外電報導）兩名知情人士告訴路透社，中國政府可能最快在7日宣布10項放寬防疫的COVID-19（2019冠狀病毒疾病）新管理措施，以補充11月公布的20項防疫優化措施。

路透社報導，不具名的消息人士今天還提到，中國可能最快於明年1月將COVID-19的管理級別，從現行最高級別的甲類傳染病降級到較不嚴格的乙類傳染病。

中國國家衛生健康委員會沒有立即回覆路透社尋求置評的傳真。

中國副總理孫春蘭上週表示，隨著Omicron病毒株的致病力減弱，加上疫苗接種普及，還有防控經驗的累積，中國疫情防控也面臨新形勢新任務。

此後，許多中國大城市開始解除廣泛封鎖措施，減少定期PCR核酸檢測，在地鐵站和公園等公共場所，也不再查驗核酸檢測陰性證明。（譯者：陳彥鈞）

Two sources told Reuters that China's government is expected to announce as soon as Monday ten new COVID-19 management measures to relax restrictions, to supplement the 20 measures announced in November. The sources also said that China may downgrade the management level of COVID-19 from the current highest level of Class A infectious disease to the less strict Class B infectious disease as early as January. The National Health Commission of China did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. China's Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said last week that as the virulence of the Omicron strain weakens, vaccination becomes more widespread, and control experiences are accumulated, China's epidemic prevention and control also faces new situations and new tasks. Many Chinese cities have subsequently begun to lift widespread blockade measures, reduce regular PCR nucleic acid testing, and no longer check for nucleic acid test negative certificates at subway stations and parks and other public places.
